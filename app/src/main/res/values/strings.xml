  <string name="book_1_body"> On the right side of the screen are buttons that make it possible to change the appearance of the hero and make it unique. The menu is called Dress Up (clothes):
  \nPresets (set) - here you can select 1 from many different characters. It is this hero that you will dress.
  \nBody - here you can choose the gender of the Gender hero (male or female), skin color (Skin), pose, color of gifts.
  \nHair (head) - here you can not only change the characterâ€™s hairstyle, but also change the bangs, choose how the individual details of the hairstyle, hair color will look.

  \nClothes (clothes) - everything is simple, the details of the wardrobe and their colors are selected.

  \nProfile - here you write the name of the hero, write down his favorite items, features and other things.
  \n </string>
  <string name="book_2_body"> At the bottom of the Home screen there are several buttons with a choice of game modes:
  \nHome - the home screen from which you can go to other activities of the game. Here you can also change the hero, choose his appearance.
  \nStudio is the most interesting game mode created for creative individuals. In the studio, lovers of cute anime characters can create cartoons and animations using the proposed tools. Actually, thanks to this mode, the game is very popular.
  \nGacha - mode, present in all Gacha games. In this version, these are gifts of various rarities that can be given to characters in Life mode. Gifts are given by NPCs (heroes of artificial intelligence, whom the character meets in Life mode). You can buy 1 item or immediately 10.
  \nMini games. There are 8 of them, each game gives you the opportunity to earn crystals for buying gifts:
  \nMathematics Ichi - here it is necessary to solve mathematical examples for a while.
  \nBecks Festival - the player will have to run from the right side of the screen to the left to catch chicken nuggets.The more you catch, the more crystals you earn.
  \nDucks and dodging - the mode is similar to the Bex Festival, but here you do not need to catch objects, but rather you need to dodge them.
  \nPhantom Remix - here you need to click on a certain point in time to get the right sound. Activity is easy to pass, but the developers were very surprised by the sounds at the time of hitting the right notes. The fact is that the Phantom is a popular Lunime character, and fans of the company expected from him, as from a DJ a little different. But what we have, we have.
  \nThe narwhal sky is a marine mammal of the cetacean family. What does it do in heaven? All questions to the creators. A girl on a narwhal flies through the sky and collects stars, but in order to collect more crystals, it is necessary to dodge the crescents.
  \nKiller whale fountain - balls fall from the sky, and the player should not let them fall into the sea. The whale should be moved around the screen so that it repels the balls.
  \nRhythm Peak party - the real rhythm is a game. Here is one endless song. The task is to prevent the notes from crossing the lower bar on the screen.
  \nRabbits - here bunnies show muzzles from minks, in order to score more points and earn crystals, you need to have time to click on a curious muzzle.
  \nIn a word, all mini-games here are very similar. After some time, you may become a little bored. But crystals for gifts must be earned.

  <string name="book_4_body"> There are several locations where the player will drive his character, talk with objects of artificial intelligence (NPS). The longer you have a conversation with him, the higher his level of friendship with you becomes. At level 4, the character will be able to ask questions from the NPC. Thus, the player will be able to learn a little about the character. If you compare all the conversations, you can trace the storyline. History copies another game of the developer, in fact, all the characters that are in Life wander from one game to another.
  \nAt level 4, you can respond to a well-drawn robot. There are 11 regions on the map:
  \n    1. Roof is the roof. You will have the heroes to travel on the school roof.
  \n    2. Park - a park. Here you can make friends with several NPCs, take a walk along the green streets.
  \n    3. School is a school, there are several interesting programmed characters who are happy to make friends with you.

  \n    9. Desert is a desert.
  \n    10. Bamboo - bamboo grove.
  \n    11. Spooky is a creepy one, in fact, it is a cemetery, and it is on it that you can find a secret character, but more on that later.
  \nIn a word, nothing outstanding: you just walk around and look around, periodically talking with computer characters. With every conversation, stamina is spent - stamina (energy), which is restored in Gacha. And for the latter, crystals are needed, which are required to be mined in mini-games.
  \n </string>
  <string name="book_5_body"> Life includes more than a hundred different characters, each of which has its own unique personality, preferences, favorite food, and so on. In order to learn more about a particular character, you must first talk to him. A conversation will give you some basic information about the person, as well as increase your level of friendship - each character has approximately six different dialog lines. Note that talking with a character will require two units of stamina (energy).
  \nOnce you have reached friendship level 2, it becomes available to ask the character various questions. There are 10 questions that your NPC hero will ask randomly. However, questions may be repeated. Unfortunately, the player cannot control this process. By asking questions, you will receive complete information about the characters: favorite food, animals, things that they are afraid of and more. All this information can then be used in a quiz.
  \nAt the 3rd level of friendship, the function of giving gifts will become available. When gifting, you will spend 5 units of stamina.
  \nAt friendship level 10, an NPC character will ask you questions about what he loves, what he doesnâ€™t like. By answering questions, you increase the level of your character.
  \nSince the game is completely in English, we have translated for you all the features of the characters you meet.

  <string name="book_16_body"> Of course, creating a series or film based on the characters of the game is a long and painstaking process. To get started, you need to install video processing applications on your smartphone:
  \n    1. Splice.
  \n    2. InShot.
  \n    3. IMovie.
  \n    4. Power Director.
  \n    5. Go Pro Quik.
  \n    6. Video Shop.
  \n    7. Kine Master.
  \nThe proposed editors can help not only build a video sequence and lay down music, but also record video from the screen (which is very important). All applications are freely available on the Google Play and App Store.
  \nThen you need to go into Studio mode. Here you should choose a character who will be the main character. On the right side of the window there are buttons with a complete selection of props, pos. Moreover, many actions are animated.
  \nIn order for the characters to move their arms and legs, walk, fight and much more, and not just make one movement, you need to enable recording from the screen and fix the animated floor. From these poses you can make a video sequence in the editor.
  \nDialogue of heroes. The Studio also has a Chat button, but this is not for communicating with other players, but a dialogue between your characters in comics or series. You can select the original cloud for the phrase. All actions can be recorded through the video editor.
  \nOn one frame, you can put several characters, also for each hero you can choose individual movements. The selection of poses in the Studio is very rich.
  \nEach pose in the editor needs to be cut separately, then glue the repeating movements. It is important to set "smooth" transitions between frames so that the animation does not "twitch". The audio sequence (one or more) is superimposed last.
  \n </string>
  <string name="book_17_body"> There are several secret characters in the game that are very interesting to chat with. Finding them without special hints is extremely difficult. Therefore, we will tell you about those heroes that we managed to find.
  \nHow to find Mo? To get started in Life mode, you should go to the location Town - Hometown. Some locations are divided into several small areas that are not displayed on the main map. Next, you need to open a map of the city and go to the Spooky location. The first place a player lands in this area is the Spookyville area. Then you should go to the very end of the location. You must go to the right side. On the way, you can chat with computer animated characters.
  \nThe final stop is the gate of the cemetery where Thorn will be waiting for you, you will definitely need to talk to him (although he will not tell you anything interesting). Further, he will open the way for you to another locality with a ghost house. At the gate of the hero, a girl CC (a strange name) meets. Here it is necessary to stand in a circle in front of her. Communicating with her is not necessary.
  \nHaving stood on a circle, you will be transported to a striped room. There are 5 circles on the floor. Enter the code here: 341552234.
  \nBut there is a catch (not without this):
  \nNumber 3 is the center circle.
  \nNumber 4 is the second circle on the right of the screen.
  \nNumber 1 is the first circle on the right side.
  \nNumber 5 - the first circle on the left side.
  \nNumber 2 is the second circle on the left side.
  \nAfter entering the combination correctly, the heroine of Mo will appear in front of you. You need to talk with the girl, after which she will appear in your friends and in additional slots on the Home screen. In the future, Mo will be able to travel through Life.
  \nHow to find Mu? Here everything is somewhat simpler: you just need to enter the circle behind Mo, and you will find yourself in a red - black room, where you also need to enter the code, jumping around circles on the floor. Despite the ease of finding the heroine, the code is quite long: 2544351154443122135. You should enter it carefully, and do not confuse the numbers.
  \nAfter entering the characters correctly, the girl Mu will appear on the screen. You also need to chat with her in order to be able to play her later or create an animation with her.
  \nHow to find Ramunade? You should go back to Spooky. At the very beginning of the location, the player will be met by a girl - kitty Autumn. After talking with the character, you need to get to the girls S.S. (as described in the Mo search). Approaching her, you need to stand in a circle behind her. After the correct execution of actions, you will be taken to the forest. The place has no name, but as in the first two cases, you must enter the code characters.
  \nThe code here is not complicated and consists of only 9 digits - 315244315. Then you find yourself in a pretty place with lovely smiling droplets, and another secret character - Ramunade will meet the traveler.
  \nHow to change the size of the heroâ€™s head? Also an interesting question. In many animated games, the heads of the characters are not proportional to the body. Some players do not like this look of electronic friends.Therefore, Gacha Life provided the opportunity to change the size of the head. To do this, go from the Home screen to the Body menu. In the lower left corner is a button with three dots. By clicking on this button, the player has the ability to change the size of the head of any character: make it larger or smaller. It is also possible to deform a funny head.

  <!--    1. Splice.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--    2. InShot.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--The proposed editors can help not only build a video sequence and lay down music, but also record video from the screen (which is very important). All applications are freely available on the Google Play and App Store.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Then you need to go into Studio mode. Here you should choose a character who will be the main character. On the right side of the window there are buttons with a complete selection of props, pos. Moreover, many actions are animated.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--In order for the characters to move their arms and legs, walk, fight and much more, and not just make one movement, you need to enable recording from the screen and fix the animated floor. From these poses you can make a video sequence in the editor.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Dialogue of heroes. The Studio also has a Chat button, but this is not for communicating with other players, but a dialogue between your characters in comics or series. You can select the original cloud for the phrase. All actions can be recorded through the video editor.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--On one frame, you can put several characters, also for each hero you can choose individual movements. The selection of poses in the Studio is very rich.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Each pose in the editor needs to be cut separately, then glue the repeating movements. It is important to set "smooth" transitions between frames so that the animation does not "twitch". The audio sequence (one or more) is superimposed last.-->

  <!--There are several secret characters in the game that are very interesting to chat with. Finding them without special hints is extremely difficult. Therefore, we will tell you about those heroes that we managed to find.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--How to find Mo? To get started in Life mode, you should go to the location Town - Hometown. Some locations are divided into several small areas that are not displayed on the main map. Next, you need to open a map of the city and go to the Spooky location. The first place a player lands in this area is the Spookyville area. Then you should go to the very end of the location. You must go to the right side. On the way, you can chat with computer animated characters.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--The final stop is the gate of the cemetery where Thorn will be waiting for you, you will definitely need to talk to him (although he will not tell you anything interesting). Further, he will open the way for you to another locality with a ghost house. At the gate of the hero, a girl CC (a strange name) meets. Here it is necessary to stand in a circle in front of her. Communicating with her is not necessary.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Having stood on a circle, you will be transported to a striped room. There are 5 circles on the floor. Enter the code here: 341552234.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--But there is a catch (not without this):-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Number 3 is the center circle.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Number 4 is the second circle on the right of the screen.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Number 1 is the first circle on the right side.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Number 5 - the first circle on the left side.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--Number 2 is the second circle on the left side.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--After entering the combination correctly, the heroine of Mo will appear in front of you. You need to talk with the girl, after which she will appear in your friends and in additional slots on the Home screen. In the future, Mo will be able to travel through Life.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--How to find Mu? Here everything is somewhat simpler: you just need to enter the circle behind Mo, and you will find yourself in a red - black room, where you also need to enter the code, jumping around circles on the floor. Despite the ease of finding the heroine, the code is quite long: 2544351154443122135. You should enter it carefully, and do not confuse the numbers.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--After entering the characters correctly, the girl Mu will appear on the screen. You also need to chat with her in order to be able to play her later or create an animation with her.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--How to find Ramunade? You should go back to Spooky. At the very beginning of the location, the player will be met by a girl - kitty Autumn. After talking with the character, you need to get to the girls S.S. (as described in the Mo search). Approaching her, you need to stand in a circle behind her. After the correct execution of actions, you will be taken to the forest. The place has no name, but as in the first two cases, you must enter the code characters.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--The code here is not complicated and consists of only 9 digits - 315244315. Then you find yourself in a pretty place with lovely smiling droplets, and another secret character - Ramunade will meet the traveler.-->

  <!--  \n\n-->
  <!--How to change the size of the heroâ€™s head? Also an interesting question. In many animated games, the heads of the characters are not proportional to the body. Some players do not like this look of electronic friends.Therefore, Gacha Life provided the opportunity to change the size of the head. To do this, go from the Home screen to the Body menu. In the lower left corner is a button with three dots. By clicking on this button, the player has the ability to change the size of the head of any character: make it larger or smaller. It is also possible to deform a funny head.-->
